This repository contains the interaction files used in

S.R. Stroberg, H. Hergert, J.D. Holt, S.K. Bogner, and A. Schwenk,  PRC(R) xxxx (2016)
  arxiv 1511.02802

The files are in the format used by NuShellX@MSU [1].
The *.int files contain the interaction.
All lines beginning with ! are comment lines.
The first non-comment line is
{ignored integer} {spe for orbit 1} {spe for orbit 2} ... {spe for orbit N} {A_core} {Z_core} {A dependent scaling exponent}

where N is the number of single-particle orbits.
All lines thereafter are of the form

a   b   c   d    J   T'     <abJT' | V | c d JT'>

where a,b,c,d are integer indices labeling the valence orbits, J is the total angular momentum,
and T' is an isospin-like parameter used by NuShellX, and V is the two-body interaction.



Note that the proton-neutron two-body matrix elements (TBME) are un-normalized,
while the proton-proton and neutron-neutron TBME are normalized.
To obtain the normalized TBME, take

<aaJ| V |ccJ>_npn    =           <aaJ| V |ccJ>_upn
<abJ| V |ccJ>_npn    = 1/sqrt(2) <abJ| V |ccJ>_upn
<aaJ| V |cdJ>_npn    = 1/sqrt(2) <aaJ| V |cdJ>_upn
<abJ| V |cdJ>_npn    = 1/2       <abJ| V |cdJ>_upn




The *.sp files are used by NuShellX to define the single-particle orbits.


Files in the TargetedNormalOrdering directory were obtained using the reference indicated in the file name.
